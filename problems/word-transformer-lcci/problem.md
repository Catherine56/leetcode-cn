难度中等1收藏分享切换为英文关注反馈

给定字典中的两个词，长度相等。写一个方法，把一个词转换成另一个词， 但是一次只能改变一个字符。每一步得到的新词都必须能在字典中找到。

编写一个程序，返回一个可能的转换序列。如有多个可能的转换序列，你可以返回任何一个。

**示例 1:**

```
输入:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

输出:
["hit","hot","dot","lot","log","cog"]
```

**示例 2:**

```
输入:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

输出: []

解释: endWord "cog" 不在字典中，所以不存在符合要求的转换序列。
```

#### [面试题 17.22. Word Transformer LCCI](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/word-transformer-lcci/)

难度中等1收藏分享切换为中文关注反馈

Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary.

Write code to return a possible transforming sequence. If there are more that one sequence, any one is ok.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
["hit","hot","dot","lot","log","cog"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []

Explanation: endWord "cog" is not in the dictionary, so there's no possible transforming sequence.
```
